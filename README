 PhotoQt v2.7 - Copyright (C) 2011-2022, Lukas Spies (Lukas@photoqt.org),

--------------------------------------------------------------------

 PhotoQt is a fast and highly configurable image viewer with a simple
 and nice interface.

 PhotoQt is available in the repositories of an increasing number of Linux distributions,
 and can also be installed in several other ways (Windows installer, Flatpak, etc.).
 Check the website (https://photoqt.org/down) to get more information on that, or
 see below for instructions about how to build PhotoQt from scratch.

 DEPENDENCIES
--------------
- Qt >= 5.9
- CMake (needed for building PhotoQt)
- Qt5 ImageFormats

> Make sure that you have the required QML modules installed:
  QtGraphicalEffects, QtMultimedia, QtQuick, QtQuick.Controls,
  QtQuick.Controls.Styles, QtQuick.Layouts, QtQuick.Window

> Dependencies that are needed by default, but can be disabled via CMake:
- LibArchive
- Exiv2
- ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick
- LibRaw
- Poppler
- LibVips
- FreeImage
- DevIL
- pugixml
- Python (incl. pychromecast package)

> Dependencies that are disabled by default, but can be enabled via CMake:
- libvips
- libmpv

> Please note that you probably want to have as many of these enabled as possible as
  they greatly enhance the experience of PhotoQt.

> NOTE
  On some systems you also need the *-dev package for compiling (e.g.
  exiv2-dev - names can vary slightly depending on your distribution). These
  packages usually can be uninstalled again after compilation is done.

> NOTE
  PhotoQt can work with either ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick, but due to
  conflicting naming schemes it is not possible to use both at the same time.
  By default GraphicsMagick will be enabled in CMake.


 OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------

> These are some libraries and tools that can add additional formats to PhotoQt
  if installed. None of them are needed at compile time, but they can be picked
  up at runtime if available.

- KImageFormats - https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kimageformats/html/index.html
- Qt plug-in for AVIF images - https://github.com/novomesk/qt-avif-image-plugin
- Qt plug-in for JPEG XL images - https://github.com/novomesk/qt-jpegxl-image-plugin
- Qt plug-in for HEIF/HEIC images - https://github.com/novomesk/qt-heic-image-plugin
- XCFtools - https://github.com/j-jorge/xcftools
- libqpsd - https://github.com/Code-ReaQtor/libqpsd
- unrar


 INSTALL
---------

1) mkdir build && cd build/

2) cmake ..

     # Note: This installs PhotoQt by default into /usr/local/{bin,share}
     # To install PhotoQt into another prefix e.g. /usr/{bin,share}, run:

     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

     # At this step you can also en-/disable any compile time features.

3) make  # This creates an executeable photoqt binary located in the ./build/ folder

4) (as root or sudo) make install
     # This (  i) installs the desktop file to share/applications/
     #      ( ii) installs some icons to icons/hicolor/
     #      (iii) installs the binary to bin/
     #      ( iv) installs the appdata file to share/appdata/


 UNINSTALL
-----------
 If you want to uninstall PhotoQt, simply run "make uninstall" as root. This removes
 the desktop file (via xdg-desktop-menu uninstall), the icons, the binary file, and
 the appdata file. Alternatively you can simply remove all the files manually which
 should yield the same result.
