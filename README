 PhotoQt v1.5 - Copyright (C) 2012-2017, Lukas Spies (Lukas@photoqt.org),

--------------------------------------------------------------------

 PhotoQt is a fast and highly configurable image viewer with a simple
 and nice interface.


 DEPENDENCIES
--------------
- Qt >= 5.3
- CMake (needed for building PhotoQt)

> Make sure that you have the needed Qt modules installed:
  QtQuick, QtQuick.Controls, QtQuick.Controls.Styles,
  QtQuick.Dialogs, QtQuick.Layouts, QtQuick.Window, QtQml.Models,
  Qt.labs.folderlistmodel, Qt.labs.settings, QtGraphicalEffects, QtMultimedia

> Dependencies, that are needed by default, but can be disabled via CMake
   (see INSTALL section):
- Exiv2
- GraphicsMagick
- LibRaw

> NOTE
  On some systems you also need the *-dev package for compiling (e.g.
  exiv2-dev - names can vary slightly depending on your distribution). These
  files usually can be uninstalled again after compilation is done.

> NOTE
  Even though GraphicsMagick initially started as a fork of ImageMagick (back in
  2002), trying to build PhotoQt with ImageMagick wont work!


 OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------
- XCFtools - https://github.com/j-jorge/xcftools
- libqpsd - https://github.com/Code-ReaQtor/libqpsd

> These dependencies are not needed for compiling PhotoQt. However, if they are
  installed, you can set PhotoQt (via settings) to make use of them for improved
  XCF/PSD support.


 INSTALL
---------

1) cd build/

2) cmake ..

     # Note: This installs PhotoQt by default into /usr/local/{bin,share}
     # To install PhotoQt into another prefix e.g. /usr/{bin,share}, run:

     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

     # PhotoQt makes use of the libraries Exiv2, GraphicsMagick ("gm") and LibRaw.
     # You can en-/disable them with the following options:
     # (if you don't specify anything, it asumes a default value of ON)

     -DEXIV2=OFF
     -DGM=OFF
     -DRAW=OFF

     # You can combine them in any way you want.
     # The following option equates to setting the three above options to OFF

     -DQTONLY=ON

     # If CMake aborts with the error that it can't find Exiv2 and/or GraphicsMagick,
     # and/or LibRaw, but you're certain that the header files are available, then
     # you can pass their locations to CMake:

     -DMAGICK_LOCATION=/path/to/graphicsmagick
     -DEXIV2_LOCATION=/path/to/exiv2
     -DLIBRAW_LOCATION=/path/to/libraw

3) make  # This creates an executeable photoqt binary located in the ./build/ folder

4) (as root or sudo) make install
     # This (i) installs the desktop file to share/applications/
     #      (ii) moves some icons to icons/hicolor/
     #      (iii) moves the binary to bin/


 UNINSTALL
-----------
 If you want to uninstall PhotoQt, simply run "make uninstall" as root. This removes
 the desktop file (via xdg-desktop-menu uninstall), the icons and the binary file.
 Alternatively you can simply remove all the files manually, that should yield the
 same result.
