 PhotoQt v2.2 - Copyright (C) 2011-2021, Lukas Spies (Lukas@photoqt.org),

--------------------------------------------------------------------

 PhotoQt is a fast and highly configurable image viewer with a simple
 and nice interface.


 DEPENDENCIES
--------------
- Qt >= 5.9
- CMake (needed for building PhotoQt)
- Qt5 ImageFormats

> Make sure that you have the required QML modules installed:
  QtGraphicalEffects, QtMultimedia, QtQuick, QtQuick.Controls,
  QtQuick.Controls.Styles, QtQuick.Layouts, QtQuick.Window

> Dependencies, that are needed by default, but can be disabled via CMake:
- LibArchive
- Exiv2
- ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick
- LibRaw
- Poppler
- FreeImage
- DevIL
- pugixml

> Please note that some of these should remain enabled if at all possible as
  they greatly enhance the experience of PhotoQt (e.g., LibArchive, pugixml).
  Others can be disabled quite safely with the only effect being the number of
  supported image formats.

> NOTE
  On some systems you also need the *-dev package for compiling (e.g.
  exiv2-dev - names can vary slightly depending on your distribution). These
  packages usually can be uninstalled again after compilation is done.

> NOTE
  PhotoQt can work with either ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick, but due to 
  conflicting naming schemes it is not possible to use both at the same time.
  By default GraphicsMagick will be enabled in CMake.


 OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------

> These are some libraries and tools that can add additional formats to PhotoQt
  if installed. None of them are needed at compile time, but they can be picked
  up at runtime if available.

- KImageFormats - https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kimageformats/html/index.html
- XCFtools - https://github.com/j-jorge/xcftools
- libqpsd - https://github.com/Code-ReaQtor/libqpsd
- unrar


 INSTALL
---------

1) mkdir build && cd build/

2) cmake ..

     # Note: This installs PhotoQt by default into /usr/local/{bin,share}
     # To install PhotoQt into another prefix e.g. /usr/{bin,share}, run:

     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

     # PhotoQt makes use of various libraries (Exiv2, ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick, etc.).
     # Many of them are enabled by default but can be disabled using CMake options.

     # If CMake aborts with the error that it can't find one of the libraries,
     # but they are in fact installed and available, then you can specify the
     # location of some of them as:

     -DMAGICK_LOCATION=/path/to/graphicsmagick
     -DEXIV2_LOCATION=/path/to/exiv2
     -DLIBRAW_LOCATION=/path/to/libraw
     -DFREEIMAGE_LOCATION=/path/to/freeimage

3) make  # This creates an executeable photoqt binary located in the ./build/ folder

4) (as root or sudo) make install
     # This (  i) installs the desktop file to share/applications/
     #      ( ii) installs some icons to icons/hicolor/
     #      (iii) installs the binary to bin/
     #      ( iv) installs the appdata file to share/appdata/


 UNINSTALL
-----------
 If you want to uninstall PhotoQt, simply run "make uninstall" as root. This removes
 the desktop file (via xdg-desktop-menu uninstall), the icons, the binary file, and
 the appdata file. Alternatively you can simply remove all the files manually which
 should yield the same result.
